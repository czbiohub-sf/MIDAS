# Pylint thinks these modules are "unused" but importing them has the side effect
# of registering their respective subcommands into the argument parser.
#
# Each subcommand module has its own main() function.  They are totally independent,
# with their own set of command line arguments and subcommand help text -- aside from
# the shared arguments and shared help text defined in midas2.common.argparser.
