Welcome to MIDAS2
====================================


Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis System 2 (MIDAS2) is an
integrated pipeline for profiling single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and gene
copy number variants (CNVs) in shotgun metagenomic reads. MIDAS2 implements
the same analyses as the original
`MIDAS <https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS>`_,
but re-engineered to addresses the computational challenges presented by
increasingly large reference genome databases.

MIDAS2 was developed by `Chunyu Zhao <chunyu.zhao@czbiohub.org>`_
and Boris Dimitrov in the `Pollard Lab <https://docpollard.org/>`_ at
Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.
MIDAS2 expands on the original MIDAS developed by
`Stephen Nayfach <snayfach@gmail.com>`_.


Source code is `available on GitHub
<https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0.git>`_.
