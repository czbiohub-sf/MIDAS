Quickstart
============

Setup
*****


Install MIDAS2
-----------------

On a Linux machine, download a copy of MIDAS2 from our GitHub repository, and
install the dependencies. We do not currently support non-Linux environments.


..
    Confirmed that this is the best install method? Seems like the most complicated one...
    I guess part of the goal here is to get all of the test reads which are saved to
    github...


.. code-block:: shell

  $ git clone https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.git
  $ cd MIDAS2

  $ conda env create -n midas2 -f midas2.yml
  $ conda activate midas2
  $ cpanm Bio::SearchIO::hmmer --force # Temporary fix for Prokka

Install MIDAS2.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ pip install midas2


Alternative installation procedures are also :ref:`described elsewhere<installation>`.


.. _example_data:

Example Data
------------

Assuming you're in the ``MIDAS2.0/`` directory you just ``cd``-ed to,
two single-end gzipped FASTQ files are in the folder ``tests/reads``.
Navigate to the ``tests`` directory ::

  $ cd tests


.. _init_db:

Pre-download SCG Genes
**********************

..
    I think you should delete this pre-loading step, since
    MIDAS is designed to do it automatically.
    If you intend to remove this functionality soon, but
    otherwise I think it fits the quickstart mentality to use
    as much of the automated stuff as possible.


Download the universal single copy genes for MIDAS Reference Database (MIDAS DB) of ``uhgg``
to a new subfolder called ``my_midasdb_uhgg`` ::

  $ midas2 database --init --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir my_midasdb_uhgg

..
    TODO: If I'm not mistaken, this will install the MIDASDB to MIDAS2.0/tests/my_midasdb_uhgg
    Seems like a mistake, since users will run the quickstart and then have to _redo_ the
    database download when they want to run MIDAS on different project...
    TODO: Is there a similar issue with using the _installation_ detailed above?
    Will users need to uninstall and re-install for some reason?

..
    TODO: Add links to the more completely explanations of each step
    elsewhere in the wiki.


.. _demo_midas_ourdir:

Identify Abundant Species
*************************

We'll start by searching for reads that align to single-copy, taxonomic marker
genes in order to identify abundant species in each sample.

.. code-block:: shell

  for sample_name in sample1 sample2
  do
    midas2 run_species \
        --sample_name ${sample_name} \
        -1 reads/${sample_name}_R1.fastq.gz \
        --midasdb_name uhgg \
        --midasdb_dir my_midasdb_uhgg \
        --num_cores 4 \
        midas2_output
    done


Single-nucleotide Variant Analysis
**********************************

Identify SNVs in Each Sample
----------------------------
..
    Is "SNV calling" an accurate description of what MIDAS is doing here?
    Seems more like this step is just about alignment to the reference
    genome and SNV-calling only really happens in the cross-sample analysis.

We'll next run the single-sample SNV analysis for each sample.

.. code-block:: shell

  for sample_name in sample1 sample2
  do
    midas2 run_snps \
      --sample_name ${sample_name} \
      -1 reads/${sample_name}_R1.fastq.gz \
      --midasdb_name uhgg \
      --midasdb_dir my_midasdb_uhgg \
      --num_cores 4 \
      midas2_output
  done

The pileup summary for ``sample1`` is written to
``midas2_output/sample1/snps/snps_summary.tsv``.
This file summarizes the read mapping
and pileup results for each of the abundant species determined in the previous
step.
By default, species are selected based on the filter:
``median_marker_coverage > 2``. More details about abundant species selection can
be found :ref:`here<abundant_species_selection>`.


Compute Population SNVs across multiple samples
-----------------------------------------------

.. _prepare_sample_list:


In order to compute population SNV from multiple single-sample pileup results, we first
need to construct a tab-separated **sample manifest file**: ``list_of_samples.tsv``.

This file has a column for the ``sample_name`` and another for
``midas_output``, and it is required for multi-sample analyses.

.. code-block:: shell

  echo -e "sample_name\tmidas_outdir" > list_of_samples.tsv
  ls reads | awk -F '_' '{print $1}' | awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1, "midas2_output"}' >> list_of_samples.tsv


..
    TODO: The shell command to build this file is a bit opaque, and users
    may have other ideas about how to build it. Maybe skip the shell
    script and just provide the manifest already in ``reads/``?

We can take a look at the ``list_of_samples.tsv``:

.. code-block:: shell

  cat list_of_samples.tsv
  sample_name	midas_outdir
  sample1	midas2_output
  sample2	midas2_output


Based on this output, we can run ``merge_snps`` and MIDAS2 will know to
look at ``midas2_output/sample1/snps/snps_summary.tsv`` for the ``run_snps``
output from sample1.


Now we are ready to compute the population SNVs across these two samples:

.. code-block:: shell

  midas2 merge_snps \
    --samples_list list_of_samples.tsv \
    --midasdb_name uhgg \
    --midasdb_dir my_midasdb_uhgg \
    --genome_coverage 0.7 \
    --num_cores 4 \
    midas2_output/merge


Users may be interested in the contents of the file
``midas2_output/merge/snps_summary.tsv`` written in this step.

.. code-block:: shell

  cat midas2_output/merge/snps_summary.tsv
  sample_name	species_id	genome_length	covered_bases	total_depth	aligned_reads	mapped_reads	fraction_covered	mean_coverage
  sample1	102454	2762447	2322823	15271923	145639	131992	0.841	6.575
  sample2	102454	2762447	2322823	15270765	145639	131982	0.841	6.574

Gene Copy-Number Variant Analysis
**********************************

Identify CNVs in Each Sample
----------------------------

Since building bowtie2 indexes for the species pangenomes takes a long time, we
first build the bowtie2 indexes for one species (102454) to a new subfolder ``bt2_indexes/``:

.. code-block:: shell

  midas2 build_bowtie2db \
    --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir my_midasdb_uhgg \
    --species_list 102454 \
    --bt2_indexes_name pangenomes \
    --bt2_indexes_dir bt2_indexes \
    --num_cores 4

More information about building your own bowtie2 indexes for either representative genome (repgenome)
or pangenome can found :ref:`here<build_custom_genome_index>`.


Now we can run the single-sample CNV analysis for each sample with the existing bowtie2 indexes.
The pileup summary for ``sample1`` will be generated under the directory
``midas2_output/sample1/genes/genes_summary.tsv``.


.. code-block:: shell

  for sample_name in sample1 sample2
  do
    midas2 run_genes \
      --sample_name ${sample_name} \
      -1 reads/${sample_name}_R1.fastq.gz \
      --midasdb_name uhgg \
      --midasdb_dir my_midasdb_uhgg \
      --prebuilt_bowtie2_indexes bt2_indexes/pangenomes \
      --prebuilt_bowtie2_species bt2_indexes/pangenomes.species \
      --num_cores 4 \
      midas2_output
  done


Compile CNVs across multiple samples
------------------------------------

Same with the population SNV analysis, multi-sample CNV analysis also requires a tab-separated
:ref:`sample manifest file<prepare_sample_list>`.


We can then merge the per-sample CNV results:

.. code-block:: shell

  midas2 merge_genes \
    --samples_list list_of_samples.tsv \
    --midasdb_name uhgg \
    --midasdb_dir my_midasdb_uhgg \
    --num_cores 4 \
    midas2_output/merge


Users may be interested in the contents of the file
``midas2_output/merge/genes_summary.tsv`` written in this step.


.. code-block:: shell

  cat midas2_output/merge/genes_summary.tsv
  sample_name	species_id	pangenome_size	covered_genes	fraction_covered	mean_coverage	aligned_reads	mapped_reads	marker_coverage
  sample1	102454	129140	4004	0.031	3.495	162476	28611	3.410
  sample2	102454	129140	4199	0.033	3.603	169286	34908	3.410
